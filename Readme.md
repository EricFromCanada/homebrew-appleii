## Requirements

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh), [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/#homebrew-cask) (optional, for casks only).


## Installation

    brew tap lifepillar/appleii


## How to install formulas

For Homebrew formulas (programs built from source and/or launched
from the command line) use:

    brew install <formula name>

For casks (files inside the `Casks` folder, which install
already built GUI applications) use:

    brew cask install <cask name>

Examples:

1. Install the bleeding edge version of [OpenEmulator](https://github.com/openemulator/openemulator) from source:

        brew install openemulator --HEAD

2. Install [4am's OpenEmulator snapshot](https://archive.org/details/OpenEmulatorSnapshots):

        brew cask install openemulator

3. Install GSPort:

        brew cask install gsport

Refer to the documentation of Homebrew and Homebrew Cask for
further details about these and other commands.
